MillCalc is a Mill Calculator for Hearthstone players, it should help them on calculating if they can get lethal out of their next play by inputing the numbers.

In case you're not used to the term, Mill is the term used in Hearthstone to a type of deck that uses the mechanic of drawing cards to make your enemy's deck run out of cards. You can find more information about it on [this Hearthstone wiki page](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Mill)

The math is simple and can be found [on this file](https://github.com/mclemente/MillCalc/blob/master/MillCalc/PlayerInfo.cs), which was inspired by this /u/bskceuk post on [this /r/Hearthstone thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3tr8h9/brotherbrann_mill_some_mill_rogue_highlights/cx8xcit).
